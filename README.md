This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

# About 

I created this app to make it quick and easy for me to take notes while browsing the web. This app is a chrome extension linked with firebase that allows the user to save any note while browsing and revisit it later.
