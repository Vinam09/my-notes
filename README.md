This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

#About the app
I created this app to make it easy for me to take notes while browsing the app. When I am trying to learn or simply reading something I wanted a quick way to either take a note or save something. This app is a chrome extension linked with firebase that allows the user to save any note while browsing and revisit it later.
